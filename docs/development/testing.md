# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the 111 Network website. Testing approaches will be defined as the project develops.

## Testing Philosophy

- Tests should verify that implementation matches specifications
- Tests should be maintainable and readable
- Tests should run quickly in CI/CD
- Test coverage goals will be defined as the project matures

## Testing Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components and functions
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test API integrations (when implemented)
- Test user flows

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user journeys
- Test critical paths
- May use tools like Playwright or Cypress (TBD)

### Accessibility Tests
- Automated accessibility testing
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing

## Testing Tools

Testing tools will be selected and documented here as they are chosen. Potential tools:
- Jest (unit testing)
- React Testing Library (component testing)
- Playwright or Cypress (E2E testing)
- axe-core (accessibility testing)

## Test Structure

Tests will be organized alongside the code they test:
- Component tests: `apps/website/components/Component.test.tsx` or `Component.spec.tsx`
- Utility tests: `apps/website/lib/utils.test.ts` or `packages/*/src/utils.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/` directory in respective app/package

## Running Tests

Test commands will be documented here once testing is set up:
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Continuous Integration

CI/CD testing strategy will be defined when CI/CD is set up.

## Security Testing

### Security Testing Guidelines
- **Dependency scanning**: Run `npm audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- **Vulnerability testing**: Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- **Input validation testing**: Test all user inputs for injection attacks
- **Authentication testing**: Test authentication and authorization flows
- **Secrets scanning**: Use tools to detect accidentally committed secrets

### Security Test Types
- **Static analysis**: Use ESLint security plugins
- **Dependency audit**: Regular `npm audit` checks
- **Input sanitization**: Test all user inputs are properly validated
- **Authentication flows**: Test secure authentication and session management
