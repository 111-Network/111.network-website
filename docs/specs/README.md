# Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for all features, APIs, and data models in the 111 Network website.

## Spec-Driven Development

We follow a spec-driven development approach:

1. **Write the spec first** - Before implementing any feature, create a detailed specification
2. **Review the spec** - Ensure completeness, clarity, and alignment with project goals
3. **Implement to spec** - Build the feature according to the specification
4. **Test against spec** - Verify implementation matches the specification
5. **Update as needed** - Keep specs updated as requirements evolve

## Spec Template

Each specification should include:

- **Overview**: What is being specified
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces/types (when applicable)
- **API Contracts**: Request/response formats (when applicable)
- **UI/UX**: Design requirements and user flows (when applicable)
- **Testing**: Test scenarios and acceptance criteria
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies or integrations
- **Future Considerations**: Known limitations or future enhancements

## Current Specifications

- `api-endpoints.md` - API specification (when APIs are defined)

## Creating a New Spec

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Use a descriptive filename (kebab-case)
3. Follow the spec template structure
4. Reference this README in your spec
5. Update this README to list your new spec

## Security Considerations in Specifications

### Security Requirements
When creating specifications, always include:
- **Input validation**: How inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Authentication and authorization requirements
- **Data protection**: How sensitive data is protected
- **Error handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS

### Security Best Practices
- **No secrets in specs**: Never include API keys, passwords, or credentials
- **Secure defaults**: Specify secure default configurations
- **Threat modeling**: Consider security threats and mitigations
- **Privacy considerations**: Document privacy implications
- **Compliance**: Note any compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)
